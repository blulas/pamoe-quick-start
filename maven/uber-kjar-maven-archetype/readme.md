# UBER KJAR Maven Archetype

This repository contains a custom [**Maven archetype**](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html) for creating an UBER Knowledge (UBER KJAR) project on a developer’s local machine, using the VS Code IDE.

## Overview

In short, Archetype is a Maven project template generation toolkit. An archetype is defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made. The name fits as we are trying to provide a system that provides a consistent means of generating Maven projects, specifically, KJAR Maven projects. The archetype will help authors create Maven project templates for users, and provides users with the means to generate parameterized versions of those project templates.

The `UBER KJAR Maven Archetype` produces a standard KJAR project structure, complete with a properly configured project `pom.xml` as well as including all of the core dependencies and build targets for a project using these types of artifacts.

The difference between the `KJAR` and `UBER KJAR` archetypes is that the `UBER KJAR` archetype essentialyl just creates a new KJAR from a group of other KJAR's, making it easier on KIE Server resources.

## Getting Started

In order to create an UBER Knowledge Jar (UBER KJAR) project using the archetype, the archetype and plugin must both be installed/deployed to a Maven cache accessible to each developer. Once this is completed, the archetype can be used by a developer using the VS Code IDE.

## What Gets Generated?

Upon successful execution of the `uber-kjar-maven-archetype`, a directory will be created for your project containg the Maven project struture for the UBER KJAR.  All standard Maven commands can now be used in order to build, deploy, and test the KJAR.

**_Note_**: There may be certain scenarios where the Git ignore file (_.gitignore_) may not be generated for the new KJAR project.  This is due to a bug in Maven's archetype genearation code.  In the event of this, please add the `.gitignore` file manually to the KJAR's root folder.

## Building the UBER KJAR Project

In order to build the project you must run the following command `mvn clean deploy`, which will build the `UBER KJAR` and store it in the enterprise artifact repository as well as the local .m2 cache. 

## Using the Archetype

This custom Maven archetype can be run from the developer workstation, build server, or any other environment where a command line tool can be used, assuming that environment has access to the enterprise Maven repository for which the archetype has been installed or deployed. Once installed into Maven, the archetype can be run via the command line.

### Using the Archetype from the Command Line

Once the archetype has been built and installed into the enterprise artifact repository, navigate to the project folder for which you would like to create the new project, and run the following command (replacing the properties with the appropriate project value):

`mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=com.ibm.dba.dmoe.maven -DarchetypeArtifactId=uber-kjar-maven-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT< -DprojectName=<project name> -DartifactId=<project artifact id>`

The command above represents the minimal set of properties for the archetype. The `-B command line option` essentially tells the archetype to run in batch mode, rather than interactive mode, which prompts for each archetype property. Each archetype property has a specific default value, set in the archetype descriptor, in the event the property is not provided on the command line. The remainder of the parameters are listed in the following table. All parameters can be added to the call to the archetype by specifying `-DparameterName=parameterValue` on the command line. Please note that most parameters have default values and are not required.

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using the **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition** product, which in turn relies on various open source tools and technology. The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these tools:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/
- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io) Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.
- [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org) Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure. If you think about business automation think about the cloud as this is where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
- [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Edition**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe?topic=getting-started-business-automation-manager-open-editions) IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions, which consists of IBM Process Automation Manager and IBM Decision Manager Open Edition, offer developers the ability to build cloud-native applications that automate business operations. IBM Process Automation Manager Open Edition is a platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate processes and business decisions. IBM Decision Manager Open Edition, a subset of Process Automation Manager Open Edition, is a separately available platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate business decisions, including complex event processing.
