# IBM Digital Business Automation - Process Automaton Manager Open Edition - Maven Adaptors

This repository contains various Maven-oriented product extensions, such as `Custom Archetypes` and `Custom Plugins` for Maven, which replace the project provisioning behavior of the lgeacy user tools.

## How To Build

This repository is built using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  If deploying artifacts to an enterprise Maven repository, please use `mvn clean deploy`, which requires configuration of the `distributionManagement` section of your project's pom.xml.

## Repository Modules

This repository is organized in a series of modules:  

1.  [**Workflow Service Maven Archetype**](./workflow-maven-archetype/readme.md) - A Maven archetype used to generate a Kogito based workflow service project.
2.  [**KJAR Service Maven Archetype**](./kjar-maven-archetype/readme.md) - A Maven archetype used to generate a KIE Server Knowledge Jar (KJAR) project.
3.  [**UBER KJAR Maven Archetype**](./uber-kjar-maven-archetype/readme.md) - A Maven archetype used to generate a KIE Server Knowledge Jar (KJAR) project that contains other KJAR projects.  This approach is primarily used when you have multiple KJAR's that you'd like to combine together to save resource space in the KIE Server.

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using the **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition** product, which in turn relies on various open source tools and technology. The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these tools:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a projectâ€™s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/
- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io) Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.
- [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org) Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure. If you think about business automation think about the cloud as this is where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
- [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Edition**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe?topic=getting-started-business-automation-manager-open-editions) IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions, which consists of IBM Process Automation Manager and IBM Decision Manager Open Edition, offer developers the ability to build cloud-native applications that automate business operations. IBM Process Automation Manager Open Edition is a platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate processes and business decisions. IBM Decision Manager Open Edition, a subset of Process Automation Manager Open Edition, is a separately available platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate business decisions, including complex event processing.
